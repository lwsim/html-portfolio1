<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! I'm Sim, currently tackling a Master's degree and working as a Graduate Research Assistant. My research? 
  It's all about understanding the nitty-gritty of how road embankments hold up on soft clay. 
  It's one part of my world that's filled with experiments, data, and lots of learning.</p>

<p>My journey started with a civil and structural engineering background, 
  working for two years in the field after my graduation from the national university in Malaysia. 
  These days, aside from my research and studies, I'm teaching myself web development. Always learning, that's me.</p>

<p>Outside of work and study, you'll often find me with headphones on, 
  lost in music, or exploring new skills and knowledgeâ€”just following wherever my curiosity leads.</p>

<p>As for personal achievements, I like to think they're all the small victories that come with solving a problem or 
  getting through a challenging day. I am pretty independent and like to tackle issues on my own, 
  but I am also all about collaboration and sharing ideas.</p>

<p>Take a look around my portfolio to check out my latest web development projects. It's where my 
  engineering mind meets creative tech. Need to connect or chat about a project? I'm just a 
  message away.</p>
